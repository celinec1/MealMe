# MealMe

MealMe is a web application that helps users find restaurants based on their location and price range preferences. The program uses the Yelp REST API to fetch restaurant data and the user either likes, dislikes, or super likes a restaurant. In the end, the user is matched with their preferred restaurant based on their previous selections.
