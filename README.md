# MealMe

The MealMe website curates a matched restaurant based on the user's location, preference price range, and their choices when swiping through the different restaurant profiles. This website is intended to help an indecisive user to choose a restaurant that they should eat and save time on their end. After the user inputs their location and price range choice, they go through a series of profiles and select the four different icons that resembles dislike, like, super-like, and whether they are ready to be matched, and if they are they click the watermelon icon. After going through all the profiles, the algorithm calculates and outputs their matched dining location based on their previous inputs.
